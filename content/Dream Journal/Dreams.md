**Night of Jan 6th-7th**

Had a series of powerful dreams this night, as I woke up twice and fell back asleep. 
- Had a dream I was doing 10 reps of a plate on bench
- Had a vivid powerful dream that I was back in Mr. B's high school class and these two brown girls were singing this powerful beautiful song about love/life. Mr. B was nodding in encouragement. As they were singing, there was like a projector like thing or screen that was showing a brown couple Indian guy and girl. Playing and teasing with each other on a park bench outside in the sun, the girl looked so happy. They would exchange brief kiss and then go back to laughing and giggling. In the dream the focus would shift in and out from the two brown girls singing in the classroom to the screen/projector like thing where the story was carrying out. It was so unbelievably powerful and cinematic feeling in terms of delivery. 
	- The screen was more joyous, loving, teasing, and childlike in nature and then the singing was more powerful and cinematic in nature
		- The dream contrasts two dimensions of love and life: The screen showing the innocence of joy and playful connection while the singing embodies the profound depth and power of raw emotion
		- Childlike wonder compared with the cinematic intensity of life's greater truths - its a reminder that love and life are both lighthearted and profound, simple yet deeply moving

**Night of Jan 7th-8th**
- Had a dream about the book i'm reading "Broken Money"
	- In the dream someone was saying how well the book was written, and that even if you don't believe in crypto or any of these concepts. If you can write and communicate in the way the book was, that you can convince anyone of anything. Even convince them of things they wouldn't believe.

**Night of Jan 10th-11th**
I had a series of dreams very profound after a drunk night. 
- First dream was something like there was a series of people on a table say like six or something. And someone was identifying each person that was "good" or like "attractive". And there was like two other people they had selected and then they were debating on the third but then selected me too. And strangely I only felt somewhat decent/good. Its interesting like external validation won't affect me much. Has to come from within
- Second dream was me and my two childhood friends needed to go to the bathroom to take a shit so so bad. So we ended up finding a mall and were searching for a mens bathroom everywhere, eventually we did find one. Once we did we ran in and there was only one stall but it was a nice gold emboldened like area. I immediately occupied the stall and my two other friends couldn't. I used it for a while I remember shitting profusely. Without really realizing it, on the outside there was a basketball game. It was so loud and lively. Finally I finished and then went to go play the game with excitement. My friend Rohan was able to go and then Kartik after. And there was a basketball game going while this was all happening the stall like opened up directly into a basketball game. I remember just playing like crazy. But the others didn't. We all had to go so unbelievably bad. 

Wow GPT gave a strong analysis on these dreams. 
1. Urgency and relief: Desperate search for a bathroom symbolizes emotional or psychological build up things been holding in or pressing that need to release
2. Gold stall is like finding a meaningful rewarding way to release this tension - golden opportunity to address pent up emotions or needs
3. Basketball game is like the action, excitement and engagement with life. Transition from relief to play suggests a process: clearing what weighs you down (emotional or physical) allows you to fully paritcipate in life's vibrancy
4. Friends Experience: Friends needing to wait indicates prioritizing own needs first, perhaps even guilt or awareness of how others might feel when you focus on yourself. However it also reflects a truth: everyone has their turn, and fulfilling needs allows you to rejoin the "game" with energy and joy
- First dream emphasis on building confidence from within, rather than relying on external opinions
- Prioritize emotional or mental "relief" to fully engage with life's opportunities and joys
- Addressing own needs can be necessary to show up and fully play the "game" of life with energy and purpose

**Night of Jan 12-13th**
Our neighbors had come over the night of the 12th for dinner. Alder shared stories of break-ins and crime in SF. It was very wild stories.
I proceeded to have a wild vivid dream in three parts
- First part someone knocks at the door and is trying to get in. I open the door immediately at first excited to see someone. But then they say in a rapid past quick suspicious way - can I see you balcony im looking around? something along those lines. I immediately get sussed out and close the door
- Then I hear yelling and craziness as the man had gotten in. Jordon who's living with me right now, had opened the door for him while I was asleep and he's going crazy. I hop on him he doesn't have any weapons and push as hard as I possibly could to push him out the door and to the stairs. Jordon keeps the door open for me to come back in. I go back in. 
- Third part is neither of us open the door and all of sudden three crazy people with crowbars were able to bust in. One of them pulls at a gun at me which immediately causes me to have submit. What is taking me so off guard is how wild and loud they are and how frantic they have burst in. We are both caught of guard. 
Part of the dreams could be stemming from in real life as my roommate Jordon was leaving the apartment in the morning. 

**Night of Late Jan**
- Dream of running/sliding/dodging towards an exit door and so many bats and flies and random other scary thinks flying at me while trying to reach the door. Really making it very scary and hard to reach the door

**Night of Feb 7th-8th**
- A very stunning dream where I could feel myself being lifted out of my body/soul it felt like I was floating in some different dimension. I could feel parts of my brain active that I had never felt before, they felt so deeply stimulated. Like I was flying. I felt deep stimulation in the brain. And in the back of my head I was able to control deep breathing still. I also had this feeling my dad would wake me up, and I played out being super super angry. I had this feeling as in the past he has woken me during deep sleep, but I wasn't even at home back in Illinois my dad wasn't around. I basically had no memory or idea of where I was, thats how deep in I was. I continued to have a series of dreams where I had no memory in them or realization of what was going on in life. 


Lot of the dream of the leg missing or being too short to reach the brakes in a car
