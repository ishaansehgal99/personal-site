My dad used to tell me growing up "whats the greatest gift you could give someone". 

I always used to get it wrong. I'd say something off. Always used to say the wrong thing. 

He would then answer "happiness". Deep down even at a young age it felt so true, although I just couldn't admit it or see it. It just felt a little too cheesy. I guess a lot of things seem cheesy until we experience them.

He was right. 

He was so right all those years as a child he told me this. It boils into the reason I live. Why I survive. It comes from an innate desire to not have to see someone face the same suffering that we all must face ourselves. That same weight.

Make them smile or make them laugh even for just a moment. 

That's why I crack jokes. 

That even though it seems absurd and what I say seems ridiculous (and it probably is). Even if its just for a moment if it can take someone out of reality and into a different world, there's magic in there. Even if its just temporary, there is something new inside. Something new to explore.

It's such a brief fleeting feeling when it happens, sometimes if done very well it can go longer and then poof its gone. Back to real living. Almost like it never happened. But its theres even if its just a moment, you made something new.

tldr; I guess what I'm trying to say is being a dumbass is such a great feeling. Another story in there somewhere.
