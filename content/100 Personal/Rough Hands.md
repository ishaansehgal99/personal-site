Family surrounded me. The excitement of the night arrived with our pride and joy, Madhav. Our jolly younger brother ran around the moonlit apartment in Gurgaon. He was ecstatic to see more family here. 

He took my hand. Just happy to see me. As soon as he did, he noticed something. I had hard calluses on my hands. He asked: *What happened to your hands?*

I looked at his wide eyes. I looked at my hands. In that moment. *I didn't know.* *What had happened to my hands?* 

Of course I *knew* what had happened. But how would that even make sense? To explain? To a child? And yet, here he was. An innocent child. A gift from God. Asking out of pure love and wonder.
