I am back in Champaign, Illinois. Sitting in Cafe Bene, as I used to for hours and hours. 

I would text my friends, my girlfriend at the time: *Hey I'm at Bene, would you meet me here?* dozens, maybe even hundreds of times. Or *"Hey I'm on Grainger third, would you meet me here?"*

My home. It feels like I belong. Like I can be comfortable here. 

This is where it all began. 

My young adulthood. My youth. My love. 

And now I see it in my brother as he leaves. 

I fell in love with this place and it loved me. 

As I walk around campus this last day before I have to leave this evening (this is my fourth day here). I take pictures of everything. Everything I can. I'll look at something and then think *"oh shit"* I'll forget it ever happened unless I take a photo of it. Trapped in this, I've been taking photos of random things all around campus. *Remember this, remember that.* If I force myself to leave a place without a photo, I start thinking about it and have to come back.

I'm a crazy person. I know it. But I think I'm ok. I'm just different. Just like with others areas of my life, I can struggle to let go. I really do. I want it to still be there, to still love me. 

But you can't take pictures of everything, just like you can't still hold everything. At some point you do have to be okay to let go. And trust that things will still be there and open to loving them when you come back. Even if they aren't the 100% exact same as they were before.

In that way Champaign is that one thing that I can finally feel comfortable with that will still love me. Even when I come back years later. I will still fall in love with it, and it with me. The love from the people, people that look like me. The safe space for "potential" without having to prove anything (or at least it feels that way looking back at it). 

I love it. I love it so much. And obviously it hurts. It hurts having to say goodbye to that chapter of "potential". That believe that you *could* be anything and *do* anything. As opposed to what you're *worth*. And what's your *job*.

That's what being a loving kid is all about. Feeling safe. Safe to explore. Safe to mess up but still be ok. Trusting in life and love. And that's what Champaign was all about. 

When I'm hurting or thinking about loss, I can think about Champaign. Not just a place but a belief that you're safe, Ishaan. That you're ok. That no ones gonna hurt you. 

Oof I'm tearing up. Should I even keep writing? That seems like a good closer no? Soon it'll be off to the next adventure.
