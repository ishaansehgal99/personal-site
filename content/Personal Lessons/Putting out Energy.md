This has been a big lesson I have learned recently and have cemented over and over again. 

Putting out good without expecting anything in return. Just putting it out. Being nice not expecting anyone to reciprocate whatsoever. 

Just being nice. Just putting it out. That's good thats important. Just putting it out. Truly not wishing anything. 

It's actually hard, cause when you go out on a limb, you feel exposed, and you want the validation back that you did the right thing. That you said something right. But you may not get it, people may act weird uncomfortable, and thats ok. Then you can adjust from there, but its important you try.
