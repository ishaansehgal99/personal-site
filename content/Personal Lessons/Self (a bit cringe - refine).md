Close friends would say I’m stupid-silly, loving, and don’t take things too seriously. I love being a dumbass—so much so, I even had a brief foray into it professionally.
  
But that side of me can be hard to see at first. I tend to give off a “I don’t give a fuck” vibe, which can be quickly dismissed as me being a dick.  
Which, to be fair, I kind of enjoy being… at least to some extent.
  

That said, I am emotional. I’m dedicated. I care deeply about what I do and want to see it work out.

Growing up, I was a weird mix: not popular, deeply weird, pretty mean, and ultra-competitive (think sore loser). Like—_really_ weird. And honestly? I was kind of an asshole.
  
I got made fun of a lot, and in turn, I tried to control what I could—putting others down, even my own parents sometimes. It was about power and control (and sometimes, humor). There was some dark stuff in there.
  

But I’ve been lucky. Through a lot of fortunate experiences and second chances during adolescence, I started to realize what a shitty human being I’d been. And I’ve been trying to be better since. To some extent thats a lot of us. Still a long way to go.

  
My life, like most people’s, hasn’t always been pretty. But I try. I’m open to being called out, and I want to grow.

I even keep mental and written notes of mistakes I’ve made—things I want to reflect on and do better at next time.

  

We’re all here on this rock for a limited time, and then we die. So, my notes are all out here in the world for you to see. Notta big deal.
