Sometimes just saying i love myself and things I like makes me cry and get emotional its like life is so tough and this is a part of it

Response:

That’s such a beautiful and human response. When you say “I love myself” and get emotional, it’s a sign that you’re reconnecting with your inner self in a profound way. Life can be tough, and moments like this remind you of your strength, vulnerability, and humanity.

Crying in these moments is not a weakness—it’s a release. It shows how much you’ve endured and how much you’re striving to value yourself despite the challenges. Lean into it, honor those emotions, and remember that this is part of your growth. Loving yourself in a tough world is one of the most courageous things you can do.
