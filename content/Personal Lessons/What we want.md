Sometimes…  
People say with enough rejection, enough loss—  
you get used to it. 
You stop caring. 
It stops mattering.

But I’ll be honest—  
I don’t think it always does.
Some days,  
I’d rather just close the book 
than stay stuck in the loop.  
That endless cycle of wanting, waiting, aching.

And then—there’s that deep feeling when someone doesn’t respond.
It hits like, _“I want it.”_  
I don’t even know exactly what “it” is.  
It’s not just about the person—it’s just having them.  
Like getting them would fulfill it, or fill something.

I wrestle with how to describe this.
But at the end of the day… does it really matter?
Still, that craving’s real.
That drive to _have it_. To reach it. 
To feel like you got what you were looking for.

It’s primal—almost animal.  
But it’s not really like just physical. It’s something deeper.  
Some kind of hunger. But what for?

Where does it even come from?  
Can it be stopped? Or is it just part of being alive?

So what’s the lesson?

Maybe it’s this:  
Desire is just desire.  
It doesn't always come with answers.  
It doesn’t guarantee fulfillment.  
Sometimes it just is.

It pulls us. Moves us. Shapes us.  
And we chase—thinking _that_ thing, _that_ person, _that_ connection  
will finally make it feel complete.

Love, connection, desire—these are the deep powers.
They make everything seem real.
They make us want deeply.

But it's so hard because
the same hand that elevates us
can destroy us too.

Life isn’t neat. 
Desire doesn’t always lead to peace.  
Sometimes it even makes things harder.

Still—we pursue.  
We love, we want, we hope.

And through it all, maybe the real goal is just this:

**Keep your cool. Keep your calm.**  
Because no matter what happens—we're all just still people.  
Trying to be a good.  
Trying to understand.  
Admitting that… we don’t really know anything for sure. 
None of us do. Really none of us.
And that just has to be ok.

It's not really a reassuring or resounding final answer. 
But I don't think there really is one.
There can't be.
What we want...is what we struggle with.
