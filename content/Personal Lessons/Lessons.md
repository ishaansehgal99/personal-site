- I was sitting with my friend Rishu Bagga in Seattle in the Pike Place Market area. 
- We were talking in English. A Punjabi older man came up to us and was yelling like crazy "Punjabi is your mother tongue, yet you don't speak it" and he was yelling so loud, we were in a tourist place so there were others around kind of just trying to ignore what was going on
- I was shocked and caught so off guard. I froze. It was pretty intense. He recognized us as Punjabi pretty quickly somehow (not the first time someone had). 
- My friend Rishu yelled back a little bit in Hindi. But it didn't matter the older man was going hard yelling. Eventually he stopped and sat down on the table diagonal to us quietly. 
- I remember feeling disappointed and not comfortable in my own skin for a bit. My friend shrugged it off but I felt super weird.
- We were eating beechers mac and cheese or ice cream I can't remember what it was, but after I was finished almost as an act of defiance I went to throw the carton confidently walking past the man on the table looking at him. I could sense the uneasiness. 
- He was a bit crazy, then I told Rishu to take a quick tourist type photo (as I was visiting) and we left. 

Being confronted about your identity is tough, especially in public. You feel uncomfortable. 
I still wrestle with experiences like this years later.

Years later I realize this experience is about self-acceptance, while in the moment I felt so angry and disappointed both with myself and the situations. It requires courage but we must accept who we are. While I froze, I think it would have been best to stand up for myself in a way that is both respectful and firm. It's ok not to have all the answers or live up to someone else's expectations of our cultural identity. I am actively learning and embracing my heritage, and I know today I would respond with self-assurance and grace, if faced with a similar situation. This is important, to at least say something.

- Rent negotiation - It felt I got a deal that was too good to be true. 2 Bed 1 Bath in arguably what I thought was the hottest neighborhood in SF (Hayes Valley) for $2200. Price was initially $2295, I asked what was the best he could do and he knocked it down to $2200. 
- However it is six floors up and it doesn't have in-unit washer/dryer and I didn't even bother to ask to go down any further. 
- Given how desperate he was to sell the place, and that it was on Zillow for months (how I don't know given it had like 700+ contacts or something) I could have at least asked
Now I have learned from this obstacle to be more in the moment and be proactive, although I don't beat myself up too much because it was natural, I was in the moment and I was so excited about the place I just wanted to sign. With all the reviews I'd seen of the flakiness of the realtor, I just wanted to get it signed and be done with it. 


**October 2024**
- I pursed a romantic thing with someone at work. There was one long date that went well. I will say looking back it did take work to find things to talk about at times as there were stops in the conversation it wasn't the same fluidity as my ex or someone say I'd have a lot of chemistry with but thats ok. Not a bad thing. 
- Also looking back she wasn't the happiest seeming person. She did seem a bit sad and this was something I'd noticed a bit earlier from earlier interactions too. 
- However she was cute looking, friends agreed. But she was very short and small, sexually I was attracted I think based of personality as she was easy going. But she was flat in both areas. I think I got more interested as things went.
- First date went very well and progressed, the texting did fizzle out. Second time she asked about me coming over late at night. She said "Want to come over?" I hesitated a bit with the typing (I think?). She went "JK" "It's late". 
- I realize now she may have been looking for a hookup or whatever. In the moment I wasn't feeling it, I felt mixed signals and I was putting effort. I do realize now though as a man in the beginning you do have to do this and this is normal. And perhaps it was ego, desire for some control, and a bit of resentment from earlier relationships I'd had, I said no next time, I knew we'd be meeting at a party in a couple days.
- We met at this halloween party and I got drunk. On text she was mentioning and asking what I was doing after the party. I didn't fully answer because I saw her in person and she was giving me not much interest in in-person interactions. In fact I introduced her to my best friend and she didn't talk at all. 
-  She left the party a couple times. I asked her to come back and she did but then left again. I got frustrated and kinda got pushy on text I said "seriously?" "like really?". I felt mixed signal between in-person and text and now looking back I see it was a work event that may have done it. But she would say nothing in-person, probably out of fear. 
- I felt terrible she stopped texting the next day. I reacted too strongly I think and was not playing it cool and confident. A couple days of inactivity I see her at work and she avoids me unless its in a group setting. Then I ask her on text later if she wants to go to an event and she says she busy. 
- I just feel like an idiot and I've beat myself up. Why the hell didn't I just go smash get another number so that at least I can say or have some ego that at least ive had some success or mean with some number of women and it'd feel somewhat good, maybe? I just want some level of success it doesn't have to be crazy but at least like a decent number of sexual partners I have one so far and I see my friends and girls have so many. My likely future girlfriend/wife will have had so many more than me. Have had all her fun with the hottest guys then settle.
- A friend recently mentioned he had 15 sexual partners in college and I hear about guys having couple partners a year post college. I haven't had any post college (its been 1.7 years). Kind of but don't fully get why. Reflecting since I moved to SF I don't approach much if at all, in NYC I went on a lot of dates however. And hookups (everything but penetration) with two women. I will still have women (albeit very unattractive) that will be sexually or romantically interested in me. But I don't know I don't know what to make of these feelings and it feels confusing and like I've missed what I did in college and then really fucked up this chance I had when I didn't need to. Its frustrating to me. I also notice when I'm more horny (haven't masturbated in a while) that this will hurt me more and I will be way more frustrated about this too during these times. 

this was God's ultimate way of teaching me to let go.

Now I have learned more about my ego and my challenge with letting go. I want it, I want to have it. I want it to be mine and have that control. I have frustration and insecurity when in early times it doesn't work out. Instead of being generous and **detached** I am invested and attached. This insecurity can mean resentment. I feel I missed out on opportunity and that its so shitty.

Biggest takeaway: **Detachment** is key
Do it and let go of outcome - you will make mistakes then forget about them
Work on this - let go of outcomes
- Learning to care without attaching your self-worth or emotional well-being to outcomes is a powerful skill. Practice generosity and openness in relationships without becoming overly invested too soon.

Say I had a friend in this situation 
I'd be so empathetic id say yeah its a complicated thing. attraction, love and making it work with women is so unbelievably hard and yeah its like not easy

I particularly feel these things in lower confidence or lonely situations. Like late at night or when I haven't had any deep social connection with friends around

I think im self reflective and harder on myself than I should be. I should focus on kindness and love with myself and detachment when its right

Lessons:
inaction often feels worse than trying and failing
were acting on built resentment
mixed signals cause doubt
hesitation reflects my inner conflict - from frustration
you don't always need control to win - trying to hold onto control can sometimes work against you, you need mutual openness not power dynamics
alcohol or overthinking can cloud your judgement (definitely cut back on this now)

Conversation with Sonal Chachi
- I was in India talking to my Aunt (father's brother's wife) she said "You look Indian but you're not"
- She said the Indians that grew up in America are strong, big and tall and good looking. This is because of the steroids they consume from the products they have which are from animals with steroids. You however, your mom always gave you organic I remember. You always had organic, not you. 
- Earlier in my life living in Germany I remember in a middle school class introducing myself proudly that "I'm from Chicago" "I'm American". A girl in the front Anne (van leeuwen I believe?), said no you're not what are you really. I paused kind of taken aback. I'd never been asked back like that before. I looked at the teacher, Mr. Manna, thinking he'd help me out here, he surprisingly just looked at me blankly as well too, like "no yeah what really are you". That's when I said im Indian and it took me off guard. 
- Something I'd veered away from yet so plain and clear for the world to see.
- Going back even earlier I had a complicated relationship with being Indian and my identity. I felt bad and ashamed being brown and had lot of being made fun of for it, a lot and lot of hate. 
- So this brief moment in time started something so nuanced and deep on who I am, who I *really* am. and how i see my identity and how i think im somehow "wrong" but not really, confused...
- This doesn't just have to be race it could even be appearance or what we wear, we may show something or portray something in a certain way or be portrayed in a certain way thats different than how we really are. it makes us think about being honest and showing who we are as people and so it takes courage to live authentically
It's hard but we have to think about ourselves we have to be a bit selfish and turn off these things, and see more about who we are as people. That could not fit into any mold it has to be us and true to us. Be detached

Refined: 
It's hard, but we need to step back from others' perceptions and expectations to truly see ourselves. We have to embrace who we are, beyond any mold or label, and stay true to that. Detachment from external judgment is key to living authentically and with self-acceptance.

Party at my SF Place
This one isn't even something I did wrong necessarily but an interesting thing I saw.
- We threw a party at my place in SF. There were roughly 40 girls that came for this friends birthday party. 
- It's the most girls I've ever hosted in my life or have seen in SF it was pretty crazy. 
- It was a fun time - very loud and our neighbors went crazy the next day (phone call update in January revealed multiple neighbors complained including neighboring buildings)
- It was interesting to note one of the larger girls was interested in me and to see her tactics with flirting were so interesting
- It was like the same exact silly tactics I've used like, silly teasing "why is there a video game controller in your cabinet", "are you good at math - what is 20% price increase on 35$ and then what change I get for 100$ (58$)" (when I got it right she teased wow and was actually impressed), she asked to open beer bottle and when I couldn't and scratched my finger she did the motherly thing where asked to see if I was ok, she listened to what I was saying when trying to explain group games, she was trying to invite to future things, and asked for my number and texted afterward about meeting up so there was very clear interest
- I let it happen it was so fascinating to have it happen so overtly and repeatedly. It felt unreal fascinating and kind of reaffirmed how we're all just human and can think in similar ways even if we are a different gender, and that to me felt so interesting and cool. So I treated her nicely the way I would want to be treated when I flirt with others, but didn't pursue.
- She even sent me an invite for a holiday party she was doing after

It was refreshing and eye-opening to be on the receiving end of such clear interest for once. It felt good to be noticed and pursued, and it reaffirmed for me that girls are just people too—capable of the same playful, thoughtful, and deliberate tactics I’ve used myself. This experience reminded me that mutual interest can feel natural and fun when it’s present. I realized this might not be about me personally but about the attention women likely receive regularly, which can shape how they interact in such situations, when deep down we can all be so similar.

Argument with Vishal Chachu
- I was in india for the holidays Dec 10-30th
- We were in Udaipur for food and I was making sarcastic jokes that my uncle recommended buying gold and didn't know what he was talking about gold didn't do well
- I did not mean he is not a good investor. My uncle is much wealthier in fact he is one of the wealthiest people I know, and he is very very successful
- This set him off as he proceeded with comments: "You don't even understand what the stock market is", and listing a series of Indian stocks and asking me "What is this" e.g. like what is "Shree Balaji ka steel" stock
- I remained silent. Eventually he repeated himself, he is a big man that commands a lot of respect and power
- I folded and said "I don't know"
- I was staying quiet because I found it really weird, and didn't have anything to prove. Looking back I could have said that "I don't have anything to prove"
- I don't know how to handle it better but it was a bit of an ego thing and part of me thought why escalate in further conflict it isn't necessary
- Definitely these emotional outbursts I have seen before in past visits so I understand and believe its an ego thing. 
- The next day he tried explaining to his son about the stock market and I was there, sitting next to him, kind of having to listen so I excused myself to get food and wasn't really interested, was a bit cringe.
Here I should be more proactive, remind myself to be detached and not really care too much what people think. However 

Refined
In situations like this, I should strive to be more proactive and stand up for myself when it matters. At the same time, I need to remind myself to stay detached and not let ego or others' opinions weigh too heavily. Not every argument is worth engaging in, and choosing when to respond and when to let go is key to maintaining both self-respect,  peace, strength and maturity.

This restraint demonstrated a level of strength and maturity, especially when dealing with a family member who commands respect and has strong opinions.

You acted with detachment by not letting your ego push you into proving yourself, which aligns with the lesson you've articulated. The key takeaway here is that sometimes the most proactive thing you can do is to step back and let go.

Coming to India while tough does lead to a lot of interesting opinions and thoughts and growth.


**January $4^{th}$ 2024**
I boarded a plane from chicago back to sf and was trying to put my guitar in the closet and was rejected saying "first priority is for wheelchairs". I should have pointed out all the wheelchair people boarded already. I should have said oh this is "fragile". I am sitting here in first class any chance we can move it later or something along those lines maybe? 

**Initial Request:**  
*“Hi, I have a fragile guitar. Is there space in the coat closet to keep it safe?”*

*“If priority items are taking up space, could we check again after boarding to see if there’s room? I’d really appreciate it.”*

**Follow-Up Mid-Flight:**  
*“Hi again, has any space opened up in the coat closet? If so, I’d be happy to move my guitar there.”*


**Jan 19th 2025**

I was talking to my assistant property manager for my place and she found in my file complaints about parties. I was described the issue and referred to my neighbor as "crazy". I don't think this was appropriate I would have rather said "anal" and I backpedaled immediately after I said it with a story describing how he bangs on my door and yells at top of his lungs. How to best deal with this moving forward. 

Lesson is its better to frame these things in a more neutral and objective way, without escalating conflict further.


**Jan 30th 2025**

I had been talking to this girl for a few weeks, and while she hinted at being friends, she was also very flirty—consistently so, over an extended period. She seemed genuinely interested in meeting up, and when we did, she even texted afterward saying it was lovely to meet me. I saw every sign of interest from her—nervousness, teasing, engagement. But I guess we hung out for too long, and as the conversation started to fizzle a bit, something shifted.

Still, she kept up the teasing and banter afterward, so naturally, I asked her out again for a picnic. This time, she abruptly shifted to saying she just wanted to be friends. The way she phrased it even felt a little patronizing—like I had misunderstood something that seemed clear. It was a sudden and disorienting change.

I don’t know how to make sense of this. I feel like I keep getting mixed signals, lead-ons, or just meeting girls who aren’t interested at all. And then I see the kind of attention other guys around me get and wonder if something is seriously wrong with me. The emotional fatigue of going through this over and over is exhausting. It feels like, in the end, it just comes down to looks.

over time I have become more emotionally detached and numb and I think this is helping. although sometimes i have to pretend im not to gain interest. wild stuff.


Lessons: 
Flirtation does not equate to romantic interest. A girl can be flirty, engaged and even affectionate but still not want to do anything. Flirtation is fun; and some people do it without strong intentions behind it.

Shorten first meetups - Overexposure (spending too much time in the first meeting)

Confidence & Detachment - Embrace detachment - Still investing emotionally in these encounters and feeling let down when they don't go as expected. Subtly over-investing, putting too much weight on one girl's interest, feeling a need to win her over. 

Slightly over-investing in each situation 
Still feeling emotionally impacted by rejection, which suggests full detachment isn't there yet
