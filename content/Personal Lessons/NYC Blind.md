I used to spend three months in NYC and I was headed to the train station like I always did after work. This was the times square station where I'd get off and get on. As you can imagine it was absolutely swarming. 

In midst of all this chaos, I saw someone confused, I can't remember if it was me who offered or he who asked. 

But needless he was looking for his train and he was a blind man that needed help. 

I asked him where he was going he was looking to take a train north, but I saw he was at the entrance for the train that went south. I told him and quickly told him id help him. 

He instinctively reached for my arm in which case I used to help guide him. I took him to the other side, part of me wasn't 100% sure but I'm pretty sure this is what he meant for where he was trying to go. 

I saw behind him it was all so fast but I think he had hooked arms with another blind man although the memory is hazy, I think I was potentially helping two blind men now. 

The station was packed. Rush hour. But it was always packed to be honest. 

As I helped him to his train platform he began now going down the stairs. I was in such a rush I forgot to even properly inform him about the stairs. Luckily he figured it out and slowly began to ascend. 

This was the first point, as I watched him come down the stairs, that I came in awe. I realized what I was dealing with, finally it had dawned on me. I immediately came out of the "rush" mindset and was here to help him. 

Now the train was either fast approaching or already there, so I was worried he would miss it. But at the same time I was worried, I wasn't 100% it was the right one, what if I was leading him onto the wrong train? 

I quickly guided him towards it and without even fully confirming he recognized I had led him to a train and just got on it. 

As the train began leaving the station, I began getting worried, did I just put him on the wrong train? now in my head I began thinking about how the uncertainty was messing with me just in that one little instance, of helping him get on the right train. 


I was reflecting on this story almost half a year later, and, now I think, oh my God, if I was so concerned about him for this one decision. Imagine all the uncertainty he must go through for all the decisions he has to make. 

Anyway as I sent him off, I stayed at the station as the train pulled off looking at him as he was on the train (although he couldn't look at me). This was yet again another one of those 100s of NYC interactions that would get lost, so short in time and duration yet so powerful and deeply emotional. 

As I was looking at the man pull away, a middle aged professional, yet young-looking asian lady was looking at me, in that moment our eyes locked. She showed empathy at me. It's like in that moment she knew exactly what I was going through, exactly what I was thinking, the concern. 

I reflect on this as its something so unique to be in a place of such unique diversity of people of such different backgrounds and perspectives and situations, and all in this one place. It's almost like one of the greatest gifts to humanity to have and be in such a place where everyone has found a way to come together in this small place. 

This was just one of countless NYC experiences that really stuck with me. There was so much magic in the air there. In the end I couldn't keep up with it all, but I did really enjoy it for the brief period it happened. 






I used to spend a few months each year in NYC, and one evening after work, I was headed to the Times Square station—like always. It was swarming, packed with people during rush hour. The usual chaos.

In the middle of it all, I noticed a man who looked confused. I can’t remember if I offered help first or if he asked me—but either way, he was blind and clearly looking for his train.

He said he was headed north, but I realized he was standing at the entrance for a train going south. I told him, and quickly offered to help. He instinctively reached for my arm, and I guided him across to the right platform. I wasn’t 100% sure it was the exact place he needed, but it seemed right.

In the blur behind him, I think he may have been arm-in-arm with another blind man. The memory is hazy—but in that moment, it felt like I was helping two people.

The station was crammed. Bodies everywhere. But that’s always how it was.

As we reached the platform, he began descending the stairs. I was still in a rush and hadn’t properly warned him. Thankfully, he figured it out on his own and carefully made his way down. That was the moment it hit me. Watching him descend those stairs, I snapped out of my tunnel-vision rush—I finally understood the weight of what was happening.

The train was arriving—or already there. I wasn’t completely sure it was the right one. I felt torn: should I stop him and double-check, or let him board? But before I could say anything, he simply got on, trusting that I had brought him where he needed to go.

As the train pulled away, I stood on the platform watching, unsure if I had done the right thing. That one moment of doubt stayed with me for months. And later, I found myself thinking: _If I felt this much uncertainty over one small decision—how much uncertainty must he live with every single day?_

As the train disappeared into the tunnel, I stood there still watching—even though he couldn’t see me. And just then, a young-looking, middle-aged Asian woman nearby made eye contact with me. There was this look of empathy on her face, like she completely understood the concern, the emotion, the weight of that moment. No words—just something human passed between us.

That’s what’s so special about New York: so many lives intersecting from wildly different backgrounds, somehow coexisting in one tiny, messy, beautiful space. That short moment—like so many others—disappeared into the noise, but it stayed with me. NYC has a kind of magic in the air. I couldn’t keep up with it all. But for a while, I really felt at it.





I used to spend a few months each year in New York. One evening after work, I was rushing through the Times Square station—like always. The place was heaving, a blur of bodies and noise. Total chaos.

In the middle of it, I spotted a man who looked lost. I can’t remember if I offered help or if he asked, but either way—he was blind, trying to find his train.

He said he was headed north. I looked around and realized he was standing at the entrance to a train going south. I told him, and offered to guide him. He instinctively reached for my arm, and I took him across the station toward the other platform. I wasn’t completely sure it was the exact one he needed, but it felt right.

Somewhere in that blur, I think he might have been linked arm-in-arm with another blind man. My memory’s hazy—but for a moment, it felt like I was helping two people.

The station was packed. Shoulder to shoulder. Every direction noise and urgency. But that’s just how it always was.

As we reached the new platform, he began descending the stairs. I’d been moving fast—still stuck in the rush—and hadn’t warned him. He paused, sensed the steps, and slowly made his way down. And that’s when something shifted.

For the first time, I stopped. I stood still. Watched him. And realized what I was actually doing. I wasn’t just rushing through a good deed. This was someone moving through the world with nothing but trust and instinct. That hit me.

The train was either approaching or already there. I didn’t know for sure if it was the right one. Part of me wanted to stop him, double-check. But before I could say a word, he just boarded—without hesitation. Trusting me completely.

As the doors closed and the train pulled away, a wave of panic hit me. _Had I put him on the wrong train?_ That little shard of uncertainty stuck with me. And weeks later, months later, it still did.

And then it hit me: if _I_ felt that much unease from one small decision… imagine the kind of faith he had to carry every single day.

I stood there on the platform, watching the train disappear. He couldn’t see me, but I watched anyway. That invisible connection lingered for a second longer. And just then, I caught eyes with a woman next to me on the platform—a young-looking, middle-aged Asian woman. Dressed sharp. Probably a professional.

She looked at me, and I swear she _knew_. She saw it. The worry, the tenderness, the weight of the moment. And in one glance, she gave me empathy. It was quiet. Wordless. But so deeply human.

That’s what makes New York magical. So many lives, so many stories, colliding in these tiny, fleeting moments. Strangers helping strangers. Strangers seeing each other. No words. Just something real.

That moment disappeared into the noise like all the others. But it stayed with me. One of those rare reminders that even in the chaos—especially in the chaos—there’s something soft and extraordinary happening just beneath the surface.
