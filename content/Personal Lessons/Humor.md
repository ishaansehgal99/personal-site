I'm kind of realizing I have classic boyish ego humor. Like making jokes about being grandiose is a classic thing.

This can be a turn off for some due to perceived lack of humility. Can reflect insecurity or need for attention. And can overshadow other qualities I bring to the table. Balance is important. 

Different approaches for different folks.
