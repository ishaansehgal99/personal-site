#### **Introduction**
Examples of a broken system

**Global Examples**
- **Lebanon (2022):** Banks froze and were not letting people get their own money back 
- **Nigeria:** 13% annualized inflation over past decade; low adoption of the government’s digital currency (eNaira) while cryptocurrencies thrived
- **Egypt:** Devalued its currency by 50% in 2016 and again in 2022–2023, erasing savings for millions
- **Turkey and Argentina:** Faced extreme inflation—Turkey at 85% (2022) and Argentina over 100% (2023).
- **Hyperinflation History:** Countries like Brazil, Zimbabwe, and Venezuela experienced hyperinflation; others, such as Israel and Mexico, faced near-hyperinflation.

**US Issues**
- The Federal Reserve underestimated inflation in 2021–2022 ("transitory"), leading to record rate hikes that caused $1 trillion in unrealized losses and major bank failures.

**Systemic Problems**
- Most currencies lose value over time, with interest rates failing to keep up with inflation, eroding purchasing power.
- **Developing Nations:** Many face sharp devaluations, inflation, and limited global acceptance of their currencies.
- **Wealthy Nations:** Even stable financial systems have faced negative-yield bonds and severe inflation-induced purchasing power erosion.
	- Negative-yield bond is where investors receive back **less money** than they originally invested by the bond's maturity
		- $\text{Yield to Maturity (YTM)}=\frac{(\text{Interest Payment} + \text{Face Value)−Price Paid}​}{\text{Price Paid}}$
**Thesis**
- The global financial system is outdated and broken, failing both developing and developed nations. Core weaknesses, exacerbated by the 2008 crisis, demand technological and structural reform.



#### Chapter 1 - What is Money?
- Money began as ledgers
	- Before writing, oral or mental ledgers were used to record debts and credits informally.
- Early Human Examples
	- Social Credit: In small communities, trust and reputation maintained informal ledgers. Favors were loosely tracked.
	- Barter Challenges: Trading with strangers relied on "spot trading", often failing cause of "double coincidence of wants" (mutual needs for each other's goods)
- Proto-Money: Shell Beads and Similar Items
	- Shell beads: Small, durable, widely valued, and aesthetically pleasing. Served as an intermediary form of payment
	- Shells beads replaced informal social credit systems when dealing with strangers
	- Decentralized Ledger: Ownership of shells naturally updated the "ledger" requiring no central authority
- Technological Impacts
	- Like many early proto-monies: advanced civilizations could exploit these systems by mass-producing shells, devaluing them, and disrupting economies



#### Chapter 2

**The Need for Money**
- Larger more complex societies required a liquid, divisible, portable and widely accepted medium for trade
- Barter became inefficient due to "double coincidence of wants" and exponentially increasing trading pairs

**Attributes of Effective Money**
Effective money is the most salable good in society, excelling in:
1. Divisibility: Can be divided into smaller units
2. Portability: Easy to transport relative to value
3. Durability: Resistant to decay or wear
4. Fungibility: Interchangeable with identical units
5. Verifiability: Easy to authenticate
6. Scarcity: Limited supply relative to demand
7. Utility: Intrinsic desirability (e.g. aesthetic or functional use)
Stock-to-Flow Ratio: Measures scarcity by comparing existing supply (stock) to annual production (flow). High ratios, like gold's (~67) ensure monetary stability

**Commodity Examples in History**
- Gold & Silver
	- Gold is durable scarce and portable but less divisible for everyday use.
	- Silver is more divisible, making it ideal for daily transactions. Together, they formed bimetallic systems.
- Shells
	- Widely used for trade due to portability but durability, but became obsolete with technological advancement (industrial production)
- Tobacco & Cocoa Beans
	- Low stock-to-flow ratio led to inflation and it failed
- Rai Stones (Yap)
	- Overproduction by outsiders devalued them
- Feathers & Beads
	- Failed due to durability and geographic relevance (value and utility limited to specific regions and cultures)

**Modern Case Studies**
- Video Game (Diablo II)
	- Rare items like SoJs naturally emerged as in-game money due to being highly salable, mimicking real-world monetary evolution
- Japanese Invasion Money
	- Forced fiat currency replaced hard money, illustrating how weak money can exploit value in occupied regions

**Takeaways**
- Monetary Evolution: Societies naturally evolve to adopt the most salable goods as money based on their attributes. Over time technological advances disrupt weaker forms of money, favoring commodities like gold and silver that resist devaluation
- Monetary Premium: Commodities with monetary uses (e.g. gold) accrue additional value beyond their utility (e.g. due to gain of trust, medium of exchange, and hedge against inflation), incentivizing production. While their inherent scarcity (high stock-to-flow ratio) sustains their value over time
#### Chapter 3
**Gold and Silver's Rise**
- Gold and silver emerged as dominant commodity monies due to their salability
	- Gold stock-to-flow ratio ~50x
	- Silver stock-to-flow ratio ~10x
- Other commodities like shells or industrial metals fell out of use as they were easier to mass-produce, making them vulnerable to devaluation

**Coinage and Standardization**
- Minted gold and silver coins simplified transactions through standardized weight, size and quality
- Governments often debased coins by reducing metal content, causing inflation and loss of trust over time

**Gold Surpassing Silver**
- Advancements in banking improved gold's divisibility (via banknotes), making it the preferred global standard over silver, which was better for small transactions
	- Banknotes allowed gold to be "subdivided" without physically cutting the metal
- Political factors, like the UK adopting the gold standard, further cemented gold's dominance

**Modern Role**
- Gold remains a key reserve asset for central banks, due to its scarcity, durability, and high value density, maintaining its status as the ultimate store of value
#### Chapter 4: Unified Theory of Money
Money's origin and definition are often debated between two primary theories: Commodity-based and Credit Based theories

**Commodity Theory**
- Rooted in works like Aristotle's *Politics* and Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations*
- Money arises to solve the barter inefficiencies (e.g. double coincidence of wants)
- Relies on naturally scarce commodities like gold, ensuring trust-minimized, salable value through physical possession

**Credit Theory**
- Rooted in Alfred Mitchell-Innes and later expanded by Keynes and Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)
- Money originates from credit systems where trade involves promises and obligations rather than physical commodities
- Relies on trust within social or state-administered systems to maintain the ledger

**Unified Theory: Reconciling the Two Theories**
- Both theories describe ways of maintaining a ledger for economic exchange
	- Commodity Money: Maintains the ledger through physical possession, using natural laws to enforce scarcity and minimize trust requirements
	- Credit Money: Relies on trust-based human systems (e.g. kinship, governance) to maintain records of obligations and payments
- The primary difference lies in who maintains the ledger: 
	- High-trust contexts: Enable credit-based systems (dominates due to convenience and efficiency)
	- Low-trust contexts: Favor commodity-based systems (dominates due to trust-minimized, final settlement independent of centralized entities)
- Over time credit systems can fail due to mismanagement or external shocks, whereas commodity money's natural constraints provide long-term stability
- Unified theory emphasizes money's role as a ledger is central to economic exchange with its form (commodity or credit) dictated by trust dynamics and societal context

tldr; Unified Theory is just saying that commodity and credit theories are just forms of either you just transact the value immediately or you give say an IOU that later on you will transact the money. Either way you are making an exchange just either immediate or in the future

#### Chapter 5: Proto-Banking and the Hawala System

**Proto-Banking Origins:** 
Early banking practices enabled secure long-distance transactions and debt settlements, predating modern banks.

**Suftaja and Hawala Systems:**
- **Suftaja:** Letters of credit used by merchants for safe, efficient long-distance payments, backed by a trusted networks and denominated in gold
- **Hawala**: Decentralized money transfer system where brokers (**hawaladars**) facilitated international payments without physical money transfer, relying on trust and reputation

**Spread to Europe:** 
- Muslim banking practices influenced Europe during the Crusades, inspiring systems like the Knights Templar, who offered secure deposits and withdrawals for traveling nobles

**Key Takeaways:** 
Proto-banking reduced reliance on physical money, enabled long distance commerce, and relied on trusted intermediaries to manage decentralized ledgers, laying the groundwork for modern banking systems.
