The DRY principle, standing for "Don't Repeat Yourself," is a software development practice that emphasizes reducing redundant code and logic. It advocates for creating reusable and modular code, minimizing repetition and making systems easier to maintain and scale.

I'm really obsessed with this principle. I'm really really not happy when people don't follow this.
